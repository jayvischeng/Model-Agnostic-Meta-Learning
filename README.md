The tf version of the wonder paper of "Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks", https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400

I have read many papers about meta-learning, many of them use rnn as a prior compont, and they acieve good results, but the theroy of meta-learning are not very convictive.

This paper is very interesting, and the theroy is fair enough, I am very recommend it, but I have not see the implemntion, so I do it myself.
